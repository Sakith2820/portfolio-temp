            <h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>

            </ul>

            <p>
                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create web pages. It provides a set of tags and attributes that allow developers to structure content and create web pages that can be rendered in web browsers. HTML documents are typically saved with a .html or .htm file extension.<br><br><br>

                HTML is based on a tree-like structure, where each tag represents a node in the tree. HTML documents start with a doctype declaration that specifies the version of HTML being used. The content of an HTML document is enclosed within an opening and closing "html" tag, and typically includes a "head" section and a "body" section.<br><br><br>
                
                The "head" section contains metadata about the document, such as the document title, character encoding, and links to external resources like stylesheets and scripts. The "body" section contains the actual content of the document, which is structured using a variety of tags such as headings (h1, h2, etc.), paragraphs (p), lists (ul, ol, li), links (a), images ("img"), and more.<br><br><br>
                
                HTML also supports a variety of attributes that can be used to provide additional information about elements, such as the source of an image or the destination of a link.
                
                Overall, HTML is the foundation of the web and is an essential technology for building websites and web applications.
                <br><br><br>
                
                HTML was first introduced in the early 1990s and has since undergone several revisions, with the latest version being HTML5. HTML5 introduced many new features and improvements, including support for multimedia elements such as video and audio, new form controls, and improved semantics for structuring content.<br><br><br>

In addition to its core markup features, HTML also works in conjunction with other web technologies such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing web pages. CSS is used to define the presentation and layout of HTML content, while JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages.<br><br><br>

HTML is designed to be a platform-independent technology, which means that web pages created using HTML can be viewed on any device that has a web browser. HTML also plays a crucial role in search engine optimization (SEO), as search engines use the markup structure of web pages to understand and index their content.<br><br><br>

While HTML is a relatively simple language to learn, it can be used to create highly complex and sophisticated web applications. Many popular web frameworks and content management systems, such as WordPress and Drupal, are built on top of HTML and rely on its markup structure to function properly.<br><br><br>
            
One of the key features of HTML is its ability to create accessible web content. This means that web pages can be designed in such a way that they are usable by people with disabilities or impairments, such as visual or motor disabilities. HTML provides a range of accessibility features, such as semantic markup for headings and lists, alt text for images, and support for ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes, which help to make web content more accessible to assistive technologies like screen readers.<br><br><br>

Another important aspect of HTML is its role in creating responsive web design. With the rise of mobile devices and varying screen sizes, it has become essential for web pages to be able to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. HTML provides a number of tools to help create responsive web design, such as the use of fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries, which allow web pages to be optimized for different screen sizes.<br><br><br>

HTML is also constantly evolving, with new features and improvements being added to the language on a regular basis. The HTML Working Group, part of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), is responsible for developing and maintaining the HTML standard, and works closely with developers and browser vendors to ensure that the language remains relevant and useful for building modern web applications.

Overall, HTML is a powerful and versatile language that is essential for building modern web applications. Its simplicity, accessibility, and compatibility with other web technologies make it a popular choice for web developers around the world.
